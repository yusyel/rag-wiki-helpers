You get German citizenship either through naturalization after living in Germany for a number of years, or you inherit it from a parent. German citizenship *can* be passed down through multiple generations who live abroad and have no idea that they are actually German citizens. But one can also lose German citizenship just as unknowingly, for example by voluntarily getting the citizenship of another country (1914-today), or due to sex-discriminatory laws that in the past often allowed only the father to pass on German citizenship to a child. If German citizenship got lost due to sex discrimination then there may now be a pathway to restore it - but often not if it was lost for other reasons.\nDo you have a German ancestor and want to know if you can get a German passport? In order to find out, we have to go through all ancestors in the line between the original German immigrant and you to determine if German citizenship was passed down.

Once they have received the signed form, they can debit the money you owe them from your account, even in the future (e.g. for your monthly electricity bill). While this sounds, at first glance, to be a major risk to you, in practice there is very little fraud using this system, as you can reverse any debit made from your account within 45 days (so check your bank statements semi-regularly just in case), and the payments are easily traceable.\nIf, in the future, you switch bank accounts, you must contact all parties you gave a direct debit authorisation to and tell them your new bank details. Your (new) bank will generally help you by pre-generating the letters and extracting contact details from your bank statements.\nPeople from other countries often balk at giving other people their bank account number, but in Germany, this is completely normal.

Precipitation (mostly rainfall) falls evenly throughout the year, with slightly more in summer than in winter. Even though Germany lies fairly far north, the warm waters of the Gulf Stream keeps it warmer than other parts of the world at the same latitude (e.g. southern Alaska, or Tierra del Fuego).\nAreas of southeastern Germany are furthest from the sea, and therefore have more pronounced temperature variation between seasons when compared with areas closer to the sea. The warmest part of Germany is in the southwest, near the French and Swiss border, whereas the coldest part (excepting the mountain areas in the Alps) is around Dresden.

If you don't follow the correct procedures, your contract will continue to run, and you will continue to be liable for the monthly costs you originally signed up for.\nFirst of all, check the termination conditions of your contract carefully. As a rule, the German telecommunication acts plans for a one-month notice for termination after the end of the initial contract commitment. For example, after a 2-year contract ends, you can send in a termination notice to your provider to get out of the contract at the end of the next month.\nYou also have to use the correct form when cancelling your contracts. Some companies allow you to do this via their website, but most require that you send them a letter or a fax. Make sure to request a confirmation from the company that your contract has actually been cancelled - until the company has confirmed it, your contract will continue running, so don't make the mistake of (for example) leaving the country and silently assuming your contract has been cancelled.\nIf you're moving abroad, you can also cancel your contract ahead of schedule, although here you have to be doubly careful to follow all the correct procedures, or else your cancellation may be invalid, and you'd have to continue paying for your contract.

So even if the air in the middle of a room (at, say, 20\u00b0C) still isn't saturated, the air near a wall (which could be at 16\u00b0C) could very well be.

However, this is a bad idea, particularly in spring, autumn, and winter, when the outside air is colder than the indoor air.\nFirstly, while leaving several windows half-open does exchange enough air between the outside and inside, reducing the humidity levels of the indoor air, it's an inefficient way of doing it, and it costs a fair amount more in heating energy when compared with *Sto\u00dfl\u00fcften*. The constant stream of cold air must be constantly offset through additional heating, increasing your energy use and heating bill (whereas with Sto\u00dfl\u00fcften you only use a little energy a few times a day, see above).\nSecondly, and more importantly, leaving windows half-open actually increases the risk for mold. The constant stream of cold outside air passes over the wall right above and next to the window. This cools down this section of the wall considerably (and does so from the inside, irrespective of how well insulated the wall is).

Whether rooms share a common kitchen and/or bathroom makes no difference.\n* Some forms of shared living space, such as asylum seeker dormitories, boarding schools, military barracks, and hospices, count as a single housing unit.\nWhile most multi-person households figure out how to split the Rundfunkbeitrag with minimal fuss, some shared flats (\"WGs\") struggle.

The *bakeries* at supermarkets, however, are often more expensive than regular ones.\n- Aldi is probably the cheapest discounter in Germany. However, do not buy booze there - the beer is sold in plastic bottles and the spirits are no-name products. The wine might be okay. Go to a beverage store or to Netto, Real, Toom to get some proper stuff.\n- Many supermarkets sell a combination of branded and no-name products. \"Gut&G\u00fcnstig\" and \"Ja!\" are very cheap brands.\n- Don't buy organic (\"Bio\") food. Although it is considered to be healthier than normal food, it is also more expensive. Germans are obsessed with organic food, just as the Brits are with fair-trade stuff.\n- Buy unprocessed foods and cook your own meals. Avoid single-serving portions and ready-to-eat meals.\n- Buy fruits and vegetables when they are in season; out of season, they can be eye-wateringly expensive.\n- Go dumpster diving, if you're into that.",

Talk to an independent health insurance broker (preferably one that works with expats), and see what your options are. [Joining the KSK](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/saving-money-germany#join-the-ksk) is a good example.\n- Every year, 3 months before your electricity, internet and insurance contracts renew themselves, start looking for cheaper options. You can save a lot by jumping between different providers and pocketing sign-up bonuses. This is common practice, and tools like Verivox automate it.\n- Make sure your rent is not illegally high. The rent is capped by the Mietpreisbremse. If you pay above the legal limit, you can get your rent reduced AND get money back for the past months.\n- Dare to live outside of cool, central areas. It can be much cheaper, quieter, and barely inconvenient. Germany has great public transportation, so living outside of the city centre is not a big problem. It can be nicer and quieter there.\n- Pay your insurance yearly, not monthly. It's cheaper.\nSource: [How to save money in Germany](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/saving-money-germany)",

Additionally, given how much independent self-study most German degrees require, you should not be too optimistic in how much you can work (and therefore earn). While everyone's financial needs and earning potential is different, broadly speaking, you should not expect to cover more than about half of your total expenses (assuming you're studying at a public university) through working - the other half will have to come from somewhere else (savings, contributions from family, etc).\nStudents in Germany do many kinds of work, including bartending and waitressing, marketing, tutoring, office support, couriers and delivery work, salesperson, tour guides, and more.

Perhaps - but, again, only under specific circumstances:\n* As above, you must be an EU citizen, or have a residence permit which allows you to freelance. Again, as above, only having overseas clients doesn't qualify you for a residence permit per se, so you'd have to meet the requirements for the residence permit a different way.\n* You must register your business in Germany, and abide by German law while running your business (this impacts e.g. the bookkeeping methods you use, which taxes you charge, etc). Obviously you also have to pay German taxes and social insurance premiums. Make sure to crunch the numbers to determine your net pay, as you may have to ask for a substantial pay rise to end up with the same net income you had before.\n* One important aspect of German law which causes problems is *Scheinselbst\u00e4ndigkeit* (\"fake freelancing\") - for more details see below. The rules in Germany are tighter than in many other countries, so \"independent contractor\" relationships in other countries are often illegal in Germany.

The Schengen visa terms clearly specify that you may work for an overseas employer during your stay, but only if that work is clearly tied to your location - for example, meeting with business partners in Germany, visiting a supplier's German factory, or scouting out new opportunities for your business in Germany. Simply doing the same work you could do from your home country in Germany is against the terms of the Schengen visa.\nNow, to be fair, the chances of you being caught are not high - but that doesn't change the fact that you'd be breaking the law, and should you be caught (e.g. if someone discovers that you lied to the immigration officer at the border when you told them that you were in Germany \"for tourism\"), then you would face a fine, deportation, and probably a very long ban on ever entering the Schengen zone again.\nNevertheless, it's *possible* to be a digital nomad in Germany - as long as you follow one of the two paths set out above.

Not being German is emphatically *not* a bad thing - on the contrary, immigrants bring a different point of view and thus enrich our lives.",

    "content": "While German public insurance is very much one-size-fits-all, there is a lot more variability in private insurance plans. For example, you can have an insurance contract with significant deductibles and co-pays (but a lower monthly premium). Many plans offer to reduce your premium if you don\u2019t submit any claims within a calendar year. Or you could have a plan that provides great cover for dental care, but very little cover for eye care. Cheaper insurance requires that you always visit a GP before seeing a specialist, while more expensive insurance covers the full cost irrespective of which doctor you see. Therefore, no matter what plan you sign up for, carefully read the details to understand what is covered and what isn\u2019t. However, I should note that German health insurers are still bound by fairly restrictive laws; as with public insurance, anything medically necessary will always be covered, so you won\u2019t find any of the typical shenanigans that US insurers sometimes pull, such as requiring pre-approval for ambulance transport or very misleading in-network/out-of-network rules.",

If you're forced to move out or sell before that (e.g. if you have a child and need more space, or you change jobs and move to a different city) you will probably end up taking a *severe* financial hit - and renting out a house that you no longer need to live in is, in most cases, not a particularly attractive option either, as being a landlord in Germany involves a *lot* of work and many responsibilities.",

The \"standard\" mortgage is a fixed-term fixed-interest-rate mortgage, usually over a period of between 5 and 25 years (15 to 20 is typical). The longer the fixed interest period is, the higher the interest rate. Interest rates vary between banks, so definitely shop around. For example, it goes up if the bank thinks the property is overpriced, they are worried that you might not be able to make your payments, or if you can put down less than about 10% of the total costs.",

Let's say you take out a 300 k\u20ac mortgage at 1% p.a. interest. 2% of the principal is 6 k\u20ac a year, or 500 \u20ac / month. The interest payments for the first year are around 3 k\u20ac, or 250 \u20ac a month. Therefore, your monthly rate is set at 750 \u20ac / month. This monthly rate stays constant until the end of the mortgage - so at the beginning, a third of the 750 \u20ac rate is going to interest, but this proportion decreases as you start paying down the principal. Note that the math is somewhat simplified, but it hopefully explains the principle. You can, of course, get a mortgage with a higher repayment rate (or a lower one, but usually at a higher interest rate - plus, you'd be paying back your mortgage for forty years or more at that point).",

Note, however, that if you pay your mortgage back too soon (earlier than ten years in most cases), then the bank will charge you for the interest they would otherwise have received. Therefore, the two most important factors in getting a mortgage approved are: 1. Does the bank think the specific house you're buying is worth the money? I.e., should you default, can they expect to recoup their losses by repossessing and selling it? 2. Does the bank think you can afford the monthly payments?",

If your score is particularly bad, the bank may refuse to lend to you (or increase the interest rate), but anyone with at least a decent credit score will get the same terms. \"Building credit\" is not a thing in Germany, and your US credit score doesn't affect a German mortgage at all.

However, this can take some time - so you should expect this, but also know your rights in case the landlord takes too long to return the deposit. TL;DR: You should get around 80% of your deposit back within about 2-6 months, and the remainder back after about 18 months. Now, in detail. The deposit is usually returned in two steps: The first step accounts for all the damages, unpaid rent, and other unpaid bills related to the apartment. The tenant and the landlord agree (in the *\u00dcbergabeprotokoll* - see above) which damages are attributable to the tenant, the landlord then repairs these, deducts the appropriate amount from the deposit, and returns most of (see below) the deposit to the tenant. This usually takes between one to three months (e.g. the time it takes for the landlord to hire a painter to repaint a wall, for the painter to bill the landlord for their work, for the landlord to deduct that amount from the deposit, and to return the rest), but no more than six months (as, by law, the statute of limitations for open claims related to a rental property is six months).",

This again underlines how important it is to fill out and sign an \u00dcbergabeprotokoll with your landlord when you leave, and immediately get a copy. The second step is to account for the utility bills for the last billing period. Recall that the tenant pays an *estimate* of their utility bills to the landlord every month (the *Nebenkosten*), and that, once a year, the landlord gets all of the actual bills, compares the actual costs to the pre-payments (the *Nebenkostenabrechnung*), and sends the tenant a bill or a refund. The billing period varies (but is usually January-December), but the bills for a billing period often only come nine to twelve months after the *end* of the period. So if you left an apartment in (say) February 2021 with a Jan-Dec billing period, then the final bills for that period would only arrive in late 2022 (about one year after the end of the billing period, which ended in December 2021), and only then could the landlord determine whether your utility pre-payments for 2021 were too low or too high - even if that's nearly two years after you left the apartment.",

Once the landlord gets all of the utility bills, they can do the Nebenkostenabrechnungen for your final billing period, deduct any open claims from the rest of your deposit, and send you the rest (or send you the rest with a refund for any money you overpaid in utility pre-payments). This second step assumes that you were renting a \"normal\" apartment.

    "content": "The principle behind *Sto\u00dfl\u00fcften* is to exchange as much of the humid, indoor air with dryer, outside air as possible. This is particularly effective in winter - the cold outside air can hold very little water vapour, so when it's warmed to indoor temperatures it's *very* dry (i.e. it has very low relative humidity). For example, fairly saturated winter air (0\u00b0C at 90% relative humidity) only holds 4 g/m\u00b3 of water vapour. When warmed to 20\u00b0C, the relative humidity drops to 25%. Many people don't ventilate in this way, as they are worried about driving up their heating bills. It's true that the (probably colder) outside air has to be warmed up again after *Sto\u00dfl\u00fcften*. However, air has a very low thermal capacity - i.e. it doesn't take much energy to heat up air. As an order of magnitude, warming up all the air in a 60 m\u00b2 apartment from 10\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C takes about 0.5 kWh of energy, which costs around 0.03 \u20ac. Most of the thermal energy in a building is in the walls - therefore, while there is a bit of heating energy lost when ventilating, the losses are comparatively small.",

Whether you will gain a place or not then depends on the final mark/GPA of your school-leaving certificate/high school diploma and so-called \"Wartesemester\" (\"waiting semesters\"), i.e. the time you have spent between finishing high school and starting your studies. The Wartesemester are accumulated automatically; the only criterion is you must not have been enrolled in a degree programme at a university. The NC is listed in the German Abitur grading system, which goes from 1.0 (the highest possible grade) to 4.0 (the lowest passing grade). If you have a foreign secondary school diploma, you need to convert your grade into the German system. This can be done using the so-called \"Modified Bavarian Formula\".

Exceptions include programmes in veterinary medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry, which require DSH-3 or TestDaF TDN5 (equivalent to CEFR C2).

Depending on your degree and its requirements, you may have to take practical work in your field through an internship. Some Graduate degrees require having an internship in order to qualify for the program, but this varies by school and program. A qualified internship can earn you an extra 30 ETCS points towards your master's program requirements. These internships often state that they require the intern to be a full-time student. This is important because Germany has implemented a minimum wage law, allowing companies to pay the intern less or not at all.

Depending on your host family's tastes, sport apparel (e.g. a jersey from a local sports team) may also be a good gift.\n- American chocolate uses different ingredients and is not to most Europeans' taste.\n- Alcohol is another common suggestion, but it strongly depends on your hosts' tastes (do they drink alcohol? A local wine or a local craft beer? Or a national liquor?); therefore, be considerate, and if you're unsure, wine is a good default option. If your hosts have kids, make sure they are above the age of 18 before giving them alcohol.\n- Certain higher-end brands (e.g. clothes, makeup, bags) are much cheaper in the US than in Europe, but particularly when buying clothes, keep in mind that American clothes are often cut more loosely than European clothes, and so may not be to everyone's tastes.\nSnacks are always a popular gift item; here are some of the more common suggestions for American snacks that are difficult to find in Germany:\n- Root beer flavored candies\n- Candy corn\n- Rare Oreo flavors\n- Chex Mix\n- Kool-Aid mix\n- Nutty bars, pecan rolls and honey buns\n- Twinkies\n- Ranch flavored things",

    "content": "There is a fair amount of confusion about this topic. **Owning** something with a Nazi symbol is perfectly legal, **publicly displaying** or **selling** it is not - except for objects are classified as art or serve to teach and educate. This means that owning a book with a Swastika on the cover (that's not about eastern mysticism) is legal, but publicly displaying it (e.g. reading on the bus) is problematic. Having a picture in your apartment of a Nazi flag is legal, walking around the streets with one is not. Having a visible tattoo with a Nazi symbol is illegal, as is doing the Nazi salute in public.\nMany World War 2 era video games sold in Germany have the Nazi symbols replaced with other symbols - even though games are classified as art (and would therefore be allowed to display Nazi symbols), game publishers don't want the hassle of having to prove they fall under the art exception clause. However, owning a game with Nazi symbols (e.g. one purchased abroad) is perfectly legal, as long as you don't show it to others (so streaming can problematic).\nHowever, books/films *about* the Nazis or the Third Reich are totally OK, as long as they don't seek to glorify the Nazi regime.\nMaking jokes about Nazis is not illegal, but are considered in very poor taste (unless done *very* carfully), and will very likely not elicit a positive response from your audience. Calling someone in Germany a Nazi is a serious insult, so casual terms like \"grammar Nazi\" should be avoided.\nThe Nazis are not a taboo subject in Germany by any means - it's probably the most-discussed and debated period in German history by far - but it's considered a serious subject. So, in general, it's recommended that you avoid making offhand or casual references or comparisons to the Nazis - it would be a bit like comparing a particularly bad commute to the [Trail of Tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears), for example.\nSee also the [Etiquette section of the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/culture/etiquette#wiki_nazi_references) and [the law governing symbols of banned organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a).",

Once they've visited a house, they will write the initials \"CMB\", with the year around it (so 2022 in the example above), either in chalk or as a black sticker with white writing on it, above the door of the house. \"CMB\" either stands for \"Christus Mansionem Benedicat\" (Christ bless this house) or \"Caspar Melchior Balthazar\" (the names of the Magi in the German tradition) - sources differ on which one it really is.

    "question": "How to make friends in Germany?",
    "content": "Germans are known to have a hard shell and are bound to be less sugary in their initial interactions than Americans, for example. The analogy that's often used is \"peach\" vs \"coconut\". Americans are (stereotypically) a \"peach\" culture - very easy to make casual acquaintances and friends, but friendships tend to stay pretty shallow. Germans, on the other hand, are stereotypically considered a \"coconut\" culture - it takes a while to become friends with them, but if you do, then friendships tend to go much deeper. It's often said that a German \"friend\" is more like an American \"best friend\".\nTherefore, it takes time and patience to become friends with Germans - so don't be discouraged if it doesn't work immediately. One challenge for newly-arrived foreigners, of course, the language. Learning German is essential to becoming friends with Germans - while many Germans speak good-to-excellent English, equally many may not be comfortable using English in social settings, or, more likely, social settings all gravitate to German by default anyway. Therefore, if you're looking to make friends, make learning German a priority.\nGermans tend to make friends through shared social activities (a setting in which communication is easy and you have common interests), as opposed to meeting random strangers (say, by chatting them up in a bar or on the train). Additionally, Germans *tend* not to be friends with their work colleagues, preferring to keep \"work life\" and \"private life\" separate.\nGermany has a very strong *Verein* (\"association\" or \"club\") culture, so joining one is usually a good way to make friends. It doesn't matter what you are into - you will definitely find an association that suits you, whether it be football, rowing, gardening, book discussion, bowling, archery, mapmaking, model railways, board games, dog ownership, ballroom dancing, or genealogy - there is very likely a Verein for that hobby nearby. Of course, you can also become a member of political or professional associations, although the latter tend to be more spread out, or start volunteering somewhere.\nTherefore, as a first stab at making friends, see if you have any hobbies which can be done with others (team sports are fantastic, but as explained above there are also plenty of others), then see if you can find groups of people (often, but not always, through a *Verein* - or, as an alternative, see if there is a \"meetup\" for your particular interest) who share your interests. Go along to their events/training/etc, start chatting to the people there, and see if you can connect with any of them. Alternatively, for parents, see if your children are interested in going on playdates with other children who attend the same school/kindergarten, and use that as an excuse to get to know their parents.\nAdditionally, there are often groups like \"new in city X\", which are great for new arrivals to meet, mingle, and chat about their experiences. Since many people will be new in a particular place, many will be open to meeting new people. The only downside is that they tend to be somewhat immigrant-heavy, and can lead to you being trapped in the \"immigrant bubble\". So by all means make friends with other newly-arrived people, but also try \"branching out\" and making friends with locals.",

    "content": "More than 98% of job openings in Germany require fluent German, and any candidate who doesn't speak fluent German won't even be considered. If you don't speak German, then you would be limited to working in the small niches which operate in English (e.g. some parts of the IT, engineering, and finance sectors). In general, emigrating to Germany without speaking German is very difficult.\nYou have 2 real options.\nFirst is probably the right solution for your situation. Apply to a German university, many classes are in English, and even entire degree programs are in English. I can't speak of the difficulty getting into a German university. A last resort way to get your foot into Germany may be US study programs that allow you to go on exchange. If you take part in an exchange, you can speak to a counsellor in Germany and see if you can transfer permanently. This will get you a study visa. Getting into a German university and a study visa will be the only visa you get.\nAnother options is that if you are currently in a job in the US and they offer to send you to Germany to work. That would be the only way for you really to get a work visa. But not having a college degree, I doubt you are currently in a job that offers a transfer to Germany.\nWhen you get into a German university you should focus on learning German culture and language as much as you do your class work.",

You still need to be able to speak German in order to set up a bank account, read important documents and contracts and get serviced at all kinds of town offices. Don't expect the municipal authorities, your mobile phone provider, or your bank to speak (or write) to you in English. Also, to truly appreciate the German culture, you need to be able to speak the language.
